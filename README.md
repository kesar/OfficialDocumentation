# The EOS Bureau of Investigation ("EBI" or "The Bureau")

## Mission Statement

 * To uphold the EOS Constitution
 * To serve and protect the EOS Community and its Members
 
## Executive Summary

The EBI's purpose is to aid enforcement of the Constitution.

The EBI does not hold any official authority to enforce; it rather aids in enforcement efforts by collecting evidence for cases to aid in the adjudication due-process.

This is done by collaborating and coordinating with the official bodies: Block Producers and Arbitrators.

## Repository

This repository contains official documentation for the EBI.

It lays out principles that altogether form the intention and promise to serve the EOS Community.

The Governing Documents are:

 * [Charter](https://github.com/TheEOSBureau/OfficialDocumentation/blob/master/Charter.md)
 * [Glossary](https://github.com/TheEOSBureau/OfficialDocumentation/blob/master/Glossary.md)
 * [More to follow]
