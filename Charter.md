# Scope

## Bodies of Law

In the abstract, Law is divided into categories:

 * Constitutional Law: that relate to governance
 * Criminal Law: that concerns offenses to society
 * Civil Law: that concerns disputes between individuals:
    * Contract Law: that concerns disputes related to fulfilment of promises between parties
    * Tort Law: that concerns wrongs to individuals that are outside the scope of any contract

Within EOS, the only codified law is the Constitution, there is no codified Criminal Code--however, Members that operate within a jurisdiction are likely subject to a state’s Criminal Code.

For Civil Law matters, concerning disputes between private parties, the Bureau does not take a position--as The Bureau serves the interest of the Community as a whole--not individual Members.

# Scope of the EBI

The Bureau operates in the scope of:
 1. Constitutional Law, in applying the EOS Constitution;
 1. upon request or order from a state will cooperate with authorities in Criminal Law matters.

## Working Groups

The Bureau will also participate in Working Groups, for the following purposes:
 * EOS Governance;
 * Codification of Laws.

Outcome of such Working Groups is intended to be submitted for vote by the community for adoption.

# EOS Governance Structure

## Separation of Powers

As per Montesquieu’s Principle of Separation of Powers, the EOS Constitution is adopted with limited powers granted to various bodies.

### Executive
Block Producers, as voted in by the Community, form the “Executive Branch,” which handles day-to-day business of running the EOS Mainnet system. They have some discretion over technical matters, as well as perform duties as ordered by the Judiciary.

### Judiciary
The EOS Constitution grants powers to duly appointed Arbitrators with the power to issue orders overriding rights of Members. However, Arbitrators--such as courts--do not seek out cases, they hear complaints brought to them by Members.

### Legislative
Rather than a group of elected representatives, the Community itself has the power to enact Law via referenda.

## Needs of the Community

At the time of writing, there is a gap for which the official bodies of governance do not cover:
 * A body to investigate violations to build a case (“EBI”);
 * An official body to action such a case, on behalf of the Community (“Attorney-General”).

## EBI’s Scope Within the EOS Governance Structure

The Bureau aims to fill the former need of the above subsection.

The Bureau has no positive powers granted to it by the Constitution; furthermore, The Bureau claims no such powers.

The Bureau’s ability to be effective subsists in virtue of its recognition by the Arbitrators, the Block Producers and the Community.

The Bureau claims no monopolistic/exclusive rights whatsoever; moreover, The Bureau encourages competition and cooperation within the space of community enforcement.

## Attorney-General

At the time of this writing, there is no appointed official to handle the actioning of cases on behalf of the Community. The Bureau does not intend to assume this role. The Bureau will work with legitimate bodies on the formation of such body.

When such body exists, The Bureau will coordinate with said body in order to assemble case files meeting a standard of proof for prosecution.

# Lawful Measures

The Bureau is bound to the Constitution and local Law--yet it may require the need to have its hands dirtied. To ensure that The Bureau does not go rogue, the following controls are in place.

## Qualified Immunity / Warrant

The Bureau may require official authorization to perform activities which would otherwise be considered violations in order to build a comprehensive case.

An ex parte hearing with Arbitrator would be in order; which would involve The Bureau presenting its case to the Arbitrator to show cause. The desired outcome from The Bureau is for the Arbitrator to issue a Warrant.

The Warrant is to be kept under seal and must specify the following:
 * The target of said investigation/operation;
 * The Law/Rule that the target is suspected of violating;
 * The Law/Rule that is intended to be violated by The Bureau’s agent;
 * The actions permitted by The Bureau’s agent;
 * The justification for such action;
 * The expiration or duration for which the actions are permitted.
